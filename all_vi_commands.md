# VIM Editor Commands

Vim is an editor to create or edit a text file. There are two modes in vim. One is the command mode and another is the insert mode.

- In the `command` mode, user can move around the file, delete text, etc.
- In the `insert` mode, user can insert text.

**Changing mode from one to another**

- From command mode to insert mode type a/A/i/I/o/O ( see details below)
- From insert mode to command mode type Esc (escape key)

- **v**   : activates the visual mode and one can move cursor to highlight required characters.
- **^v**  : Highlight vertically. Very useful for inserting tab in multiple lines.
